    "ANS- ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical technique used to compare means of two or more groups. It assumes that the data is normally \n",

    "    \n",
    "The following are the assumptions required to use ANOVA:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Normality: The data should be normally distributed. This means that the distribution of the data should be bell-shaped with a symmetrical shape. \n",
    "                  Violations of this assumption occur when the data is skewed, has outliers or has a non-normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Homogeneity of variances: The variances of the groups being compared should be equal. This means that the variation within each group should \n",
    "                                 be similar. Violations of this assumption occur when the variance of one group is much larger or smaller than the \n",

    "\n",
    "    3. Independence: The observations should be independent of each other. This means that the values within each group are not influenced by the \n",
    "                     values in the other groups. Violations of this assumption occur when there is dependence or correlation between the observations \n",
    "                     in the different groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of violations that could impact the validity of the results include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Non-normality: When the data is not normally distributed, ANOVA may produce inaccurate results. \n",
    "    For example, if the data is skewed, the mean may not accurately represent the central tendency of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Heteroscedasticity: When the variances of the groups are not equal, ANOVA may produce inaccurate results. \n",
    "    For example, if the variance of one group is much larger than the variance of the other group(s), the difference between the groups may be \n",
    "    exaggerated.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Dependence: When the observations are not independent, ANOVA may produce inaccurate results. \n",
    "    For example, if the same individuals are measured multiple times, their responses may be correlated, violating the independence assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, ANOVA is a powerful statistical technique, but it requires certain assumptions to be met to ensure accurate results. \n",
    "Violations of these assumptions can lead to inaccurate or biased results, so it is important to check for these violations before interpreting \n",
